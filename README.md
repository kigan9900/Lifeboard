# Lifeboard
A Micropad with ease-of-life shortcuts that, with the click of a button, open up Google Classroom, YouTube, etc.

# Inspiration
I always procrastinate on my work, so I always have to do it at the last minute. So cutting time down to do something before the due date is always the utmost priority. This is where I had the idea of the lifeboard, a board that would have shortcuts to things that I needed to open up. For example, I needed to open up an AP World assignment that is due in an hour, I could press 3 buttons on the keypad to open up Google Classroom, ChatGPT, and YouTube, cutting down my time by almost 2 miniutes.
